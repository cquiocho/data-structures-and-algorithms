# Challenge Summary
Write a function called BinarySearch that uses a search algorithm on a sorted list to search and find a specific value within the list.

## Challenge Description
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
Collaborated with James Swift to come up with a logical approach to solving this challenge by discussing and examining the problem domain, steps of the algorithm, expected inputs and outputs, pseudo code, test driven development and a visual representation.
